## An example of the program's execution

The following is an example of the program's execution, as it should be. Boldfaced, italicized text indicates input, while normal text indicates output.Note that the map data (the maneuvers, latitudes and longitudes, etc.) are hypothetical; I haven't taken them directly from MapQuest, since the goal of this example is to demonstrate the format.
